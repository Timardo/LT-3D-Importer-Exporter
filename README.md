# LT 3D Importer
An addon for [Little Tiles Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/littletiles) that makes building even more exciting!

This mod allows you to import a 3D model (currently only in .obj format) as a Little Tiles structure.

Unbelievably, it requires LittleTiles as well as CreativeCore mods to run. Go find them on CurseForge if you don't have them yet.

The only limit with this mod is your computer (and Minecraft)

For more information on how to use this mod [visit the wiki.](https://github.com/Timardo/LT-3D-Importer/wiki)

## TODO

 - Preview the model in its full 3D glory, somehow?

 - Ability to rotate, resize or move precisely the model in a preview state?
 
 - Transform bones or similar parts of a model from supported formats?

 - Minimize tiles used? (remove those players cannot actually see)

 - Make the importing server friendly
 
 - Add support for more formats (Blockbuster mod?, FBX?)
 
 - Check if there is a way to make it even faster?

 - ~~Make it even faster~~ [Done]

Kudos to Fredlllll for [his plugin](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/print3d). It would have taken me much more time figuring out how to work with textures without it.

This mod uses [Obj lib](https://github.com/javagl/Obj) for loading obj files.
